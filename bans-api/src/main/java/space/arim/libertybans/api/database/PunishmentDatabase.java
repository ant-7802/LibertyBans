/**
 * Access to the raw database. <b>Use of this should be avoided at great cost.
 * Executing SQL queries is not considered traditional API.</b> <br>
 * <br>
 * The majority of users should never touch this directly. Instead,
 * {@link PunishmentSelector} provides predictable, error-free functions
 * using stable API. {@code PunishmentSelector} may be used to retrieve
 * punishments with all sorts of details from the database. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>API Status</b> <br>
 * Use of the SQL backend directly is not considered traditional API. Although
 * attempts will be made to limit the number of breaking changes, LibertyBans's
 * major version will not necessarily change to match the SQL backend. Unlike
 * other plugins, LibertyBans makes use of a wide swath of SQL queries and
 * operations, so a rigid table structure is not feasible. <br>
 * <br>
 * Rather, a <i>separate version</i> is maintained specifically for the SQL
 * backend. This version is returned by {@link #getMajorRevision()} and
 * {@link #getMinorRevision()}. Additionally, it is located in the table
 * <code>libertybans_revision</code>, with the {@code major} and {@code minor}
 * columns indicating the major version and minor version, respectively (both
 * columns use the INT data type). <br>
 * <br>
 * Whenever the tables and/or views definitions change incompatibly, this major
 * version will be incremented. This minor version will be incremented as new
 * tables and views are added or existing ones changed, but not in ways which
 * break backwards compatibility. <br>
 * <br>
 * Stored routines are not supported within any versioning context. Use of any
 * SQL functions or procedures created by LibertyBans is strictly unsupported.
